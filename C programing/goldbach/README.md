Assignment given in the class CS450: Systems Programming at Emory University 

Instructor : Prof. K. Mandelberg
Used OS: Unix 
Language: C
Used file: goldbach.c

Instructions: 
To run program, make a.out file through terminal. Using the a.out created by the terminal, enter the number that will be the largest number that primes will be constructed. Then to fully test the program, enter the even number greater than 5 and smaller than the number initially inserted. The program will not exit until terminated manually. 

Overview:
The program conducts all possible prime numbers until it reaches the maximum number first initiated through terminal. Then for any even input value smaller than the initial input, shows the largest prime numbers that can be add up to the input number. Also it generates total number of possible solution. 

Sample Output:
Calculating odd primes up to 100...
Found 24 odd primes
Enter Even Numbers > 5 for Goldbach Tests
88
Largest 88 = 41 + 47 out of 4 solutions
50
Largest 50 = 19 + 31 out of 4` solutions
